    I would like to build an app that lets users find interresting activities happening in their city. It can be any activity such as bike ride, going to a musuem, bar, art show.
    Strangers can meet and become friends and enjoy different activities. A nice feature to implement is a profile of users that you can interract with and stage page that is showing what
    is happening now. 

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
